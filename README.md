# Ticket Verification Service

A mobile app that scans for and passes QR codes to a [verification microservice](https://github.com/cr4z/ticket-verification-service) I have deployed in GCP.

## Testing

Pull the project, install packages, and run `npm run start` from the terminal. This will launch React Native Expo and print a QR code. Install the Expo Go app on your Android or iOS, and scan the QR code. This will launch the project from your phone.

Use this PNG sample of concert ticket QR codes to see it in action:
